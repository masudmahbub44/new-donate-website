                <h1>FOOD FOR A FAMILY</h1>
                <P>Food is one of the basic needs of human life. <br>It provides people the energy and nutrients they
                    need
                    to
                    grow
                    and develop, gain strength, and work productively. <br>According to Abraham Maslow’s Heirarchy of
                    Needs,
                    a
                    motivational psychological theory, food is an innate physiological need along with water, warmth and
                    rest.<br>
                    This supports the importance of food in everyone’s lives.
                </P>

            <p>Bangladesh is a tropical and low land country. <br>This country faces floods every year. Neighboring
                India is
                also a huge responsibility for this. <br>In the rain falling season, India opens its switch gate and
                that’s
                why the water level gets an increase in Bangladesh. Flood has been a common problem here. </p>

        <p> Flood is one of the natural disasters and mostly risky.It happens when too much water is
            collected
            in any area. <br>It often happens because of heavy rain. The overflow of rivers causing this
            natural
            disaster is widespread in rural areas. <br>Moreover, the melting of snow also occurs. The dam
            breaking
            down is another reason for flooding.</p>
